Private Facts
==============

Storing data for other people comes with several expectations
    * Don't lose the data
    * Don't let the wrong people see it.

Tahoe-LAFS handles those expectations.
Private facts is an example project to learn how a developer can interact with Tahoe-lafs from a user-facing application.
